1, The purpose of namespaces and header files;
  

The purpose of namespaces is that when many programmers design a program together and they may use
  same identifier name, that may lead to problems. 

By using namespaces, programmers are free to use any identifiers in their own namespace. so when the client code calls these identifiers, they could 
 use "::" 
to 
make the computer clear which namespace the identifier comes from, then the client code
  would not confuse the meaning. 

 

The header files usually consist of prototypes of functions. In C++, we will design different modules
  and give each module it's own header file. Sometimes
one
 module want to use a function in another module,
  by including other modules' header file, this module's .cpp code they could access and use functions 
 
in other
 modules.

2, Why header files should not be compiled;
 
 
Because header files would be included in many .cpp files and If header files could be compiled, then
  this code would be compiled at the beginning of those
 .cpp
 files being compiled which will lead to problems. For example, if we make a function definition inside the header file then it could appear warning for multiple 
definitions. So we only could put global variables, class and function prototypes. 





3, Why you should never include .cpp files in another file.
  

Because it could violate one definition rule. When include one .cpp files in other file, what function or variables had been defined in this file, if there are called in
the caller file, then the compiler would meet duplicate definition and make warnings. So we should never include .cpp files in another file.
 
4,Quiz 1 Reflection
  In the quiz 1, 
I was wrong with the first question "What is the purpose of namespaces". I have already
  gave my new answer at the 
the beginning of this reflection.
