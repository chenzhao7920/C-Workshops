1)The copy assignment operator copies the content of one object to the current object. We should check if 
   the current object is equal to the current object, because, in this function, we are allocating new dynamic
   memory for the current object, before that, we should delete the old memory, if source object equal to current
   object, then we will delete the source content and  lost source content, and the code's output would be wrong.
2) In my copy constructor, I must initialize my current object's pointer data member as "nullptr", this is to protect
   my code.  because if my pointer accidentally points to an address of the source object, then the code would not 
   copy the content of the source object.
3) If the parameter of the copy constructor is not sent by reference, the compiler would give a warning saying that
   it may have no parameter of Contact type. The reason is that If an object is passed as value to the Copy the
   Constructor then its copy constructor would call itself, to copy the actual parameter to the formal parameter.
   Then there will be an endless loop in this function.
